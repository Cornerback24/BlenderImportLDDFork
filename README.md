# Blender Import LDD
-----------------------

Blender Lego Digital Designer importer.                    
For Blender 3.6

Changes:          
--------
1: I've tweaked the old importer to combine the same materials, and export the decorations properly - it had started to error.              

2: Materials can be split if needed in Blender, but means all of the same material can be tweaked at once - much faster!          

3: Materials are also now named rather than just numbered.         

4: Bricks have their full name too.            

Where to find the new option:

Images still need a mixShader to enable correct alpha blending, as shown below:
